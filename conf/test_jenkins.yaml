    min: 10
    Number: 10
Camera:
  icon: photo_camera
  info: <div align='center'><div class='info-box'><span class='error'>Warning!</span><br>
    Please make sure there is <strong>no one in front of the camera</strong> after
    submiting the camera settings as this will likely effect the background extractor
    that is trained on startup.<br><br>You can debug the Background Extractor and
    make sure that individuals are being extracted properly by making sure the contour
    (white rectangle) follows an individual when entering the view of the camera.
    <br>If this is not happening please follow <a href='https://idmy.team/tutorial/background-extractor'
    target="_blank">this tutorial</a>.<br></div></div>
  Run:
    info: Decide whether you would like to have the camera running. If this is off
      there will be no new recognitions.
    type: switch
    val: 1
  Live Stream:
    info: Decide whether you would like to have the live stream on. This is necessary
      for setting up / debugging the camera and also for the initial training images.
      But should be switched off otherwise to improve system reaction speeds.
    type: switch
    val: 1
  Silent Mode:
    info: Having this on will prevent the system from uploading images to be recognised
      and just show the live stream for taking photos of the member.
    type: switch
    val: 0
  Mask:
    info: Having this on will let you see the background extractor mask in the <a
      href="live-stream">Live Stream</a>. Should show original image when no one is
      infront and white section with black background when someone is.
    type: switch
    val: 0
  Mask Threshold:
    info: Alter this when debugging the Mask images (turn on Mask and view the <a
      href="live-stream">Live Stream</a>) to reduce noise by increasing the threshold
      but too much and you won't extract the whole body (more dangerous for the system).
      Should show the default background when no one is infront of the camera and
      a white section with a blackground when someone is.
    type: range
    min: 0
    max: 200
    step: 10
    val: 40
  Flip Vertically:
    info: Depending on the installation of the raspberry pi, you may need to flip
      the camera vertically. Use the <a href="live-stream">Live Stream</a> to debug.
    type: switch
    val: 1
  Resolution:
    info: The lower the quality, the more photos will be taken and less data will
      have to be stored and transferred. The higher the quality the more accurate
      the recognition algorithm will behave.
    type: select
    options:
    - 640 x 480
    - 1280 x 720
    - 1640 x 922
    val: 640 x 480
  Framerate:
    info: Change the framerate of the camera. If set to 0 this is set automatically.
    type: range
    min: 0
    max: 30
    step: 1
    val: 0
  Shutter Speed:
    info: Change the shutter speed (ms) of the camera. If set to 0 this is set automatically.
    type: range

Recognition:
  icon: face
  Training Mode:
    info: Having this on will send all classified images to be confirmed manually
      on the <a href="/classify">classify</a> page. And all uploaded images will not
      be used for online learning. When starting off a teams model we highly recommend
      turning this on to improve recognition accuracy.
    type: switch
    val: 1
  Upload Cropped:
    info: Decide whether you would like a cropped image of the contour around the
      movement (faster recognition) or not (less likely to produce no result).
    type: switch
    val: 1
  Secure Upload:
    info: Upload to our server using HTTPS or not (HTTP). Using HTTPS is more secure
      but will result in slower upload speeds. We cannot guarantee that the images
      will not be intercepted by a man in the middle attack when not using HTTPS.
    type: switch
    val: 1
  Re Recognition:
    info: The amount of <strong>seconds</strong> the system will wait before running
      the recognition <a href="script">Script</a> on the same Member. If the member
      is recognised again the system will wait the time again. Meaning that if someone
      stays infront of the camera they will not be recognised again.
    type: range
    min: 0
    max: 120
    val: 10
  Id Threshold:
    info: Having a higher threshold will reduce the amount of false positives (Marking
      Susie as Dave). Having a lower threshold will give a 'shot' at harder to recognise
      individuals.
    type: range
    min: 0.5
    max: 0.99
    val: 0.5
    step: 0.01
  Movement Percentage:
    info: This will upload an image to be recognised on the server if a certain percentage
      of the frame is different from the background (Indicated by <strong>the number
      in the <a href="live-stream">Live Stream</a></strong>). Having a higher movement
      percentage will likely ask for recognition less frequently reducing bandwidth.
      Having a lower percentage will pick up small changes in the background (potentially
      a fly landing on a wall).
    type: range
    min: 0.2
    max: 10
    step: 0.1
    val: 2
Retract Recognition:
  icon: settings_backup_restore
  Time:
    info: When clicking the button or calling the <strong>/retract</strong> endpoint
      all previously taken images within the specified time period (in <strong>seconds</strong>)
      will be sent for manual <a href="/classify">classification</a>.<br><i>To be
      used when a false classification occurs (David is classified as Dom).</i>
    type: range
    min: 5

    step: 5
    val: 10
Training:
  icon: people_outline
  Recurring Time:
    info: The time when all manually classified images should be uploaded to remote
      server to be retrained and then deleted. <strong>Warning</strong> during this
      time the raspberry pi will likely be under a lot of pressure so we recommend
      choosing out of hours.
    type: time
    val: 00:30
  Size Limit:
    info: The max size of the classification directory (in <strong>MB</strong>) before
      it should be classified remotely and then deleted. <strong>Warning</strong>
      during this time the raspberry pi will likely be under a lot of pressure so
      we recommend choosing a medium size.
    type: range

    info: The server will store all future predicted images for improved recognition
      accuracy.
